 This is the final group project for COMP 426 Mordern Web Programming. 
 
I am responsible for the frontend, and my teammate focuses on backend. 

Our website allows user to sign up and connect to their Spotify account through Spotify API. Then we will display all signed-up users' playlists for people to explore. 

Users can like and comment on other user's playlists! We also have a search function that allows users to search for playlists containing certain key words. Debouncing is used for smoothier search word recommendation experience.
